# 🛒 Instacart Sales Analysis: Python Data Analysis Project

📽️ **Project Overview**

Instacart is a leading online grocery platform with strong overall sales performance. However, to enhance competitiveness and improve customer engagement, the company seeks deeper insights into consumer purchasing behavior and order trends. In this project, I leveraged Python and its data analytics libraries to uncover actionable insights and offer strategic marketing recommendations.

🎯 **Objectives**

Key business questions addressed in this analysis include:

- What are the busiest days and hours for placing orders?
- Which time periods generate the highest customer spending?
- How can product price ranges be grouped into categories for easier analysis?
- Which departments are most popular among shoppers?
- How can customers be segmented based on loyalty, demographics, and ordering patterns?

🧰 **Tools & Technologies**

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Environment for iterative coding and analysis documentation.
- **pandas & NumPy**: For data cleaning, transformation, and statistical computations.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For visualization and pattern detection.
- **Anaconda**: To manage libraries, packages, and environments.

🗃️ **Data Set**

This analysis combines several open-source datasets provided by Instacart:

- **Instacart Core Data**:
  - Product, aisle, department, and order-level transactional data
  - Data Dictionary for reference
- **Customer Supplementary Data**:
  - Demographic details, loyalty segmentation, and purchase behaviors

**Format & Storage**:
- Format: CSV files
- Size: Varies by table (some files exceed 1M rows)
- Storage: Organized into local folders with standardized naming for reproducibility

🚀 **Project Workflow**

1. **Environment Setup**  
   Install Anaconda and set up the Jupyter Notebook workspace.

2. **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**  
   Import CSV files, review schema, assess data types, and perform sanity checks.

3. **Data Cleaning & Merging**  
   Handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize naming, and merge datasets via common identifiers.

4. **Analysis & Exploration**  
   - Identify peak order times by day and hour  
   - Assess customer spend patterns across order periods  
   - Categorize price points into defined tiers  
   - Measure product popularity by department  
   - Segment customer base using behavior and demographics

5. **Visualization**  
   Use bar charts, histograms, line plots, and cross-tab visuals to clearly communicate trends.

6. **Reporting & Documentation**  
   Summarize insights into a narrative report with code commentary, visual evidence, and strategic takeaways.

7. **Packaging**  
   Organize project artifacts for use in a professional portfolio.
