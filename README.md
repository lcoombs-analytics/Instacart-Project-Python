Instacart Sales Analysis: Python Data Analysis Project

📽️ Project Overview

Instacart is an online grocery platform with strong overall sales. However, to sharpen their competitive edge, the company is exploring deeper insights into customer behaviors and sales patterns.  In this project, I analyzed the available data using Python to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations for enhancing targeted marketing efforts.

🎯 Objectives

The key business questions and objectives for this project include:

• Identify the busiest days and hours for orders to optimize ad scheduling.

• Determine which time periods yield the highest customer spending for informed product promotions.

• Simplify product price ranges into intuitive categories to better direct marketing efforts.

• Assess product popularity by department to identify areas of market strength.

• Segment customers based on loyalty, demographics, and ordering behaviors for targeted campaigns.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

• Python: Primary language for data manipulation and analysis.

• Jupyter Notebooks: For developing and documenting the analysis process.

• pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis.

• matplotlib & seaborn: For creating effective visualizations.

• Anaconda: To manage environments and dependencies.

🗃️ Data Set

The Instacart analysis utilizes multiple open-source datasets including:

• Instacart Data Sets:

 – Data Dictionary
 – Transactional and order data
 
• Customers Data Set:

 – Supplementary data on customer demographics and purchasing behavior
 
Size & Format:

• The datasets are available as CSV files (with varying sizes) and are merged based on a common identifier.

• Data is stored locally and in standardized folder structures for reproducibility.

🚀 Project Workflow

1.	Environment Setup: Install Python (preferably via Anaconda) and set up the Jupyter Notebook environment.
2.	
3.	Data Loading & Exploration: Import the Instacart and customer datasets; conduct initial data exploration and descriptive checks (head, tail, shape, and basic statistics).
4.	
5.	Data Cleaning & Merging: Clean the data, address missing values, and merge datasets using common identifiers.
6.	
7.	Analytical Exploration:
8.	
 - Analyze order patterns across days and hours.
 - Examine customer spending habits over time.
 - Group product price tags and assess department popularity.
 - Segment customer profiles based on loyalty, demographics, and ordering patterns.
  	
10.	Data Visualization: Generate at least four types of visualizations to communicate insights.
11.	
12.	Reporting & Documentation: Compile findings, develop a final report with recommendations, and create supporting documentation (data dictionary, code comments, etc.).
13.	
14.	Packaging: Organize the project files and deliverables as a portfolio-ready case study.
15.
